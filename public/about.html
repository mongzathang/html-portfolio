<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Do Sian Pau, and I am a passionate Web Developer based in Malaysia.</p>

<p>I enjoy creating modern, user-friendly, and responsive websites that bring ideas to life on the internet. 
  My journey in tech started with a curiosity for how websites work, and it has grown into a career 
  where I constantly learn and explore new technologies.</p>

<p>Currently, I am pursuing my studies at university, where I continue to sharpen my skills in programming, design, 
  and problem-solving. I believe in combining creativity with technical knowledge to build solutions that make a real impact.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not coding, I love exploring new tools, staying updated with the latest web trends, and continuously improving my craft. 
  My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful digital experiences.</p>
